            h3 Chrome
            p Just by visiting the site, Chrome should have already stored it as a search engine. Just go to Chrome's search engine settings and find duckduckstart.com in that list, then click "Make Default" next to it.
            p If that didn't work try clicking 
                a(href='#', onclick='window.external.AddSearchProvider("https://duckduckstart.com/opensearch.xml");') here
                // a(target="_blank", href="javascript:;", onclick="nui(); return false;", class="btn") here
                |  to force it to be added. Alternatively try this link too
                a(href="javascript:installSearchEngine('https://duckduckstart.com/opensearch.xml')") here
                or here too
                a(href="#", onclick="window.external.AddSearchProvider('https://duckduckstart.com/opensearch.xml');") here

            p Click the little dropdown arrow in the Firefox search bar, then click "Add DuckDuckStart" to save it. You might have to click it again to make it your default.

                strong Awesomebar
            p Visit 
                a(href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Location_Bar_search#Location_Bar_search_.28external_-_search_engine.29") this page with instructions
                |  and use the following URL as the search string (or see below if you want to use a localized Start URL):
            code https://duckduckstart.com/?query=
            br
            br
            hr

            h3 Other Browsers & Launchers
            p DuckDuckStart should be easy to add to any browser or launcher (Alfred, GnomeDo, etc.) that supports custom searches.
            p Just use this search string in your browser/launcher's search engine options to create a custom search:
            code https://duckduckstart.com/?query=SEARCH
            p (Replace SEARCH with whatever your browser/launcher expects the placeholder to be).

            hr
            h3 Using a custom search engine
            p If you would like to use another search engine other than Startpage (Like Bing or Yahoo), simply put the url and a
                code  %q
                |  where the search goes, like so:
            code https://duckduckstart.com/?query=searchstring&searchengine=http://searchengine.com/?query=%q
            p For example, if you use Chrome and want to default your search to Yahoo, use this:
            code https://duckduckstart.com/?query=%s&searchengine=http://search.yahoo.com/search?q=%q
            p Make sure to put the
                code  http://
                |  or the
                code  https://
                |  before the URL.
            p Also be aware that DuckDuckStart will default to startpage.com if there is an error in the syntax.
